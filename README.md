# Colorado-Tranportation-Transition
Set of files and scripts showcasing the economic, energy, and policy related changes in the transportation industry of Colorado.


This repository contains the files necessary to run the .qmd script showcasing an exploratory sample of what can be done with the economic, energy, and legislative data available. While the data is collected for the state of Colorado, the collection process can be faceted to reflect any state in the United States. 

Data from the FRED was collected from a manual process.

Data from the EIA's SEDS was collected using an API call and requires an API key for access, if you would like to download from the raw source (outside of this repo). 

Data from the DSIRE was collected from a table web-scrape. This data source contains deeper levels of information, but they are much more difficult to access at a large scale.
